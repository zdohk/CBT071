//* --  Welcome to the CBT Overflow Tape.  This tape contains    -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  material that was deleted from older CBT tapes because   -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  the regular CBT Tape filled up.                          -- *   DOC FILE

//* --  There is much other useful stuff on this tape, which     -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  is hard to find.  Look below to get a glimpse at some    -- *   DOC FILE

//* --  I have included a lot of code on this tape, which        -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  never got a chance to be included in the CBT Tape.       -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  Four files, 012 thru 015, contain the UK GUIDE tape,     -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  the German GUIDE tape, the Swiss GUIDE tape, and the     -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  Australian GUIDE tape, respectively.  These alone,       -- *   DOC FILE

//* --  Short note:   Since the MVS SHARE Tape (SPLA TAPE)       -- *   DOC FILE

//* --  I have also included some newer code too, that doesn't   -- *   DOC FILE

//* --  have been the "SHARE ISPF Smoke and Mirrors Tape".       -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  This is from Jim Marshall, and was a SHARE project       -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  that got started, but which was unable to continue.      -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  A prototype first tape was produced, and that is what    -- *   DOC FILE

//* --  We have now included the entire "SHARE MVS Tape" on      -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  this tape.  SHARE MVS Tape (or "SPLA Tape") Version      -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  46, was the last tape that was supported by the SHARE    -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  organization.  The SPLA MVS Tape is now "officially      -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  dead" as far as the SHARE organization is concerned.     -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  Therefore we have included it in its entirety, here.     -- *   DOC FILE

//* --  The original doc for SPLA Tape Version 46 is on File     -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  104.  All other SPLA Tape files are on this tape in      -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  100 plus the file number on the original SPLA Tape,      -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  except for the L.A. MVS Users Group Tape material, as    -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  per our comments just below.                             -- *   DOC FILE

//* --  However, we are updating some of the files of the SPLA   -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  Tape as required.  We have, in effect, taken over all    -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  the code from the SPLA Tape on this tape.  (Thanks to    -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  Dan Squillace of the SAS Institute in Cary, North        -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  Carolina.)  Since the SPLA tape had included a version   -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  of the Los Angeles MVS Users Group Tape, we have         -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  updated those files to the highest version of the L.A.   -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  Users Group Tape that we have, Version 72.  Furthermore, -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  we have separated out the files from the LA UG Tape and  -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  placed them in their own block of files, Files 060-070.  -- *   DOC FILE

//* --  The PDS command is now on File 040, and has been         -- *   DOC FILE

//* --  The documentation from the original SHARE MVS Tape has   -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  been merged into this documentation.  File numbers have  -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  been adjusted.  The original documentation from SPLA     -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  Tape V46 is on File 104 of this tape, and will be kept   -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  there for reference without change.                      -- *   DOC FILE

//* --  Additionally, this tape will be a reference tape to      -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  find a lot of older code, that people may want to learn  -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  from.  Much of it may still work on modern systems, or   -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  it may be slightly alterable to work.  In that regard,   -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  this "OVERFLOW" tape will be a little different from     -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  the regular CBT Tape which has mostly more current       -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  code.  This tape will have quite a bit of older code,    -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  but people need a place to find it when they want to     -- *   DOC FILE
//* --  look at it.  Nevertheless, there will be quite a bit     -- *   DOC FILE

//*  MY OWN PRACTICE IS TO CREATE A PDS THAT CONTAINS THE CONTENTS  *   DOC FILE

//*  THE JCL ON FILE 003.  THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF VARIATIONS        *   DOC FILE
//*  AMONG PEOPLE ON HOW THEY HANDLE A CBT TAPE.                    *   DOC FILE

//*  ONE THING FOR SURE--TRY TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THIS TAPE    *   DOC FILE
//*  IS UPDATED QUITE FREQUENTLY.  IT PAYS TO STAY AS CURRENT AS    *   DOC FILE
//*  POSSIBLE.                                                      *   DOC FILE

//*  ONE FURTHER NOTE.  MOST SOURCE FILES ARE NOW IN IEBUPDTE       *   DOC FILE
//*  SYSIN FORMAT SO THAT THE TAPEMAP PROGRAM CAN REPORT ON         *   DOC FILE
//*  MEMBER NAMES CONTAINED IN THESE FILES.  THIS MEANS THAT        *   DOC FILE
//*  THEY ARE UNLOADED PDS'ES.  PLAIN SEQUENTIAL FILES THAT WERE    *   DOC FILE
//*  ON THE TAPE BEFORE, HAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO PDS'ES WITH A       *   DOC FILE
//*  SINGLE MEMBER, SO THE TAPEMAP PROGRAM CAN REPORT THE MEMBER    *   DOC FILE

//*  MOST NEW FILES ARE BEING STORED ON THE TAPE WITH ISPF STATS    *   DOC FILE

//*           both be reels, or both cartridges of the same         *   FILE 006
//*           format (like 3480, 3490IDRC, or 3490E).  Do not mix   *   FILE 006
//*           these.  //IN can be different from //OUTx, however.   *   FILE 006
//*           It is my experience that when the //IN (input tape)   *   FILE 006
//*           was of different media type than the //OUTx (output   *   FILE 006
//*           tapes), this program has always worked flawlessly     *   FILE 006
//*           to convert the tape to a different media format.      *   FILE 006
//*                                                                 *   FILE 006
//*           I fixed the COPYMODS program to copy tapes with       *   FILE 006
//*           up to 64K blocks.  I've also added many other fixes,  *   FILE 006
//*           most of them having to do with teaching the program   *   FILE 006
//*           about Standard Labels.                                *   FILE 006

//*           I've also solved the 2-tape-marks-together problem    *   FILE 006
//*           when you have a null SL tape file.  The program will  *   FILE 006
//*           now copy past that point, if it has seen a HDR1 or    *   FILE 006
//*           HDR2 label before the 2 tape marks.                   *   FILE 006

//*           Under PARM control, this program can now copy         *   FILE 006
//*           initted tapes, and optionally change the VOLSER       *   FILE 006
//*           of the copied SL initted tape.  Thus, you can init    *   FILE 006

//*      SIMULATES A RASTER-SCAN GRAPHICS DISPLAY.  EACH PLOT       *   FILE 143
//*      REQUIRES ONE PRINTER PAGE, WHICH IS FILLED WITH TEXT,      *   FILE 143
//*      SPECIAL SYMBOLS AND MOSAIC CHARACTERS.  THE AREA OF        *   FILE 143
//*      THE PLOTTING SURFACE IS DETERMINED FROM THE SIZE OF        *   FILE 143
//*      THE PRINTER FORM USED, WHILE THE RESOLUTION OF THE         *   FILE 143
//*      IMAGE DEPENDS UPON THE SIZE OF CHARACTERS USED.  EACH      *   FILE 143
//*      PAGE IS TREATED AS A MATRIX OF CHARACTER CELLS AND IS      *   FILE 143
//*      FILLED BY CALLS TO THE PLOT AND SYMBOL SUBROUTINES.  A     *   FILE 143
//*      SEPARATE IMAGE IS MAINTAINED BY EACH OF THESE              *   FILE 143
//*      ROUTINES.  THE PLOT IMAGE IS FORMED FROM MOSAIC            *   FILE 143
//*      CHARACTERS, WHICH CONSIST OF SIX RECTANGULAR PIXELS        *   FILE 143
//*      ARRANGED IN TWO COLUMNS.  SIXTY-FOUR MOSAIC CHARACTERS     *   FILE 143
//*      ARE USED REPRESENT ALL COMBINATIONS OF THE SIX PIXELS.     *   FILE 143
//*      THE SYMBOL ROUTINE BUILDS AN IMAGE FROM TEXT               *   FILE 143
//*      CHARACTERS AND CENTRED GRAPHICS SYMBOLS.  AT THE           *   FILE 143
//*      COMPLETION OF EVERY PLOT, THE TEXT IMAGE IS MERGED         *   FILE 143
//*      ONTO THE MOSAIC ONE, WITH NON-BLANK TEXT CHARACTERS        *   FILE 143
//*      ERASING OVERLAID MOSAICS.  THE COMPLETED PLOT IS THEN      *   FILE 143
//*      WRITTEN OUT TO AN EXTERNAL PRINT FILE AND PRINTED ON       *   FILE 143
//*      THE TARGET DEVICE USING THE PAGEPLOT GRAPHICS              *   FILE 143
//*      CHARACTER SET.                                             *   FILE 143

//*      B.  GDA VERSION 2 WILL READ THE USER'S "PREFIX.GDA.DATA"   *   FILE 199

//*      B.  GDA VERSION 2 NOT ONLY RECOGNIZES THE ISPPROF DDNAME   *   FILE 199

//*          VERSION   2   SEARCHES   FOR    A   DATASET   CALLED   *   FILE 199
//*          "USERID.ISPF.PROFILE" AND SUBSTITUTES  THAT NAME FOR   *   FILE 199
//*          THE ASTERISK,  JUST AS IT SUBSTITUTES  CERTAIN OTHER   *   FILE 199

//*          TWO SPIN-OFF ADVANTAGES TO  THIS TECHNIQUE RESULTED.   *   FILE 199
//*          FIRST,  THE  PROLIFERATION  OF  USER-UNIQUE  PRIMARY   *   FILE 199

//*          SECONDLY,   APPLICATION   OF  MAINTENANCE   TO   THE   *   FILE 199
//*          IBM-SUPPLIED LIBRARIES  WOULD NOT RESULT  IN ENQUEUE   *   FILE 199

//*          ER  AND  HAS  NOT   SIMILARLY  GAINED  CONTROL  OVER   *   FILE 199
//*          USER-UNIQUE PRIMARY  OPTION MENUS  SHOULD HEED  THIS   *   FILE 199
//*          EXAMPLE CAREFULLY.  IT  HAS PROVEN TO BE  ONE OF THE   *   FILE 199

//*  CONSIDERATION OF THE PROBLEMS  ASSOCIATED WITH ALLOCATION OF   *   FILE 199
//*  EXISTING DATASETS  WHICH MUST  BE SHARED  AMONG SEVERAL  TSO   *   FILE 199

//*  EACH OF THESE TECHNIQUES HAS  SOME DRAWBACKS ASSOCIATED WITH   *   FILE 199
//*  IT.  THE ALLOCATION OF DATASETS AT LOGON TIME BY INCLUDING A   *   FILE 199
//*  DD-CARD FOR EACH DATASET IN THE LOGON PROCEDURE IS THE METH-   *   FILE 199
//*  OD MOST PRONE TO DISASTER.  IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS THAT, WHEN   *   FILE 199
//*  A PARTICULAR USER IS LOGGING ON TO TSO, ONE (OR MORE) OF THE   *   FILE 199
//*  DATASETS REFERRED TO IN THE  LOGON PROCEDURE HE/SHE IS USING   *   FILE 199
//*  IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME.   THE REASONS MAY BE THAT THE   *   FILE 199
//*  VOLUME ON WHICH IT RESIDES IS  NOT MOUNTED, THAT THE DATASET   *   FILE 199
//*  IS BEING USED EXCLUSIVELY BY ANOTHER  TSO USER OR BATCH JOB,   *   FILE 199
//*  OR THAT THE DATASET HAS BEEN DELETED, EITHER ACCIDENTALLY OR   *   FILE 199
//*  INTENTIONALLY.  THESE SITUATIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS ERROR CONDI-   *   FILE 199
//*  TIONS.   EVEN THE  DELETION  OF THE  NEEDED  DATASET MAY  BE   *   FILE 199
//*  APPROPRIATE, UNDER  CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH  AS MIGRATION   *   FILE 199
//*  OF DATA, RECREATION OF A VOLUME, ETC.                          *   FILE 199
//*                                                                 *   FILE 199
//*  THE PROBLEM WITH INCLUSION OF THE DATASETS IN THE LOGON PRO-   *   FILE 199
//*  CEDURE IS THAT  WHENEVER ANY DATASET REFERRED TO  IN A LOGON   *   FILE 199
//*  PROCEDURE IS NOT  AVAILABLE, FOR ANY REASON,  ALL TSO LOGONS   *   FILE 199
//*  USING THAT PROCEDURE  WILL FAIL.  IF THE  DATASETS ARE TRULY   *   FILE 199
//*  ESSENTIAL  TO  THE  SESSION, THIS  MAY  BE  THE  APPROPRIATE   *   FILE 199
//*  RESPONSE.  BUT, MORE THAN LIKELY,  SOME TSO PROCESSING COULD   *   FILE 199
//*  BE PERFORMED WITHOUT  ONE OR MORE OF THE  DATASETS.  IN SUCH   *   FILE 199
//*  CASES, THE TSO LOGON PROCESS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PROCEED.     *   FILE 199
//*                                                                 *   FILE 199
//*  ANOTHER DIFFICULTY  WITH INCLUSION  OF DATASETS  IN THE  TSO   *   FILE 199
//*  LOGON PROCEDURE  IS THAT  DIFFERENT USERS  REQUIRE DIFFERENT   *   FILE 199
//*  DATASETS.  IT  IS OFTEN DESIRABLE TO  HAVE AS MANY  USERS AS   *   FILE 199
//*  POSSIBLE  USING THE  SAME LOGON  PROCEDURE.  THIS  PRECLUDES   *   FILE 199
//*  ALLOCATION DURING LOGON OF  USER-SPECIFIC DATASETS, THAT IS,   *   FILE 199
//*  DATASETS BELONGING  TO A  SPECIFIC USER,  GROUP OF  USERS OR   *   FILE 199
//*  APPLICATION, SUCH  AS THOSE  THAT BEGIN  WITH THE  USERID OR   *   FILE 199
//*  SOME APPLICATION MODULE IDENTIFICATION CODE.                   *   FILE 199
//*                                                                 *   FILE 199
//*  WHERE DATASET  SECURITY PACKAGES SUCH  AS RACF OR  ACF-2 ARE   *   FILE 199
//*  INVOLVED, INCLUSION  OF USER-SPECIFIC DATASETS IN  THE LOGON   *   FILE 199
//*  PROCEDURE MAY  RESULT IN  SECURITY VIOLATIONS  DURING LOGON,   *   FILE 199
//*  AND SUBSEQUENT  TERMINATION OF THE  LOGON PROCESS.   THIS IS   *   FILE 199
//*  NOT A DESIRABLE SITUATION.                                     *   FILE 199
//*                                                                 *   FILE 199
//*  IT IS CLEAR THAT ALLOCATION  OF SHARED DATASETS BY INCLUSION   *   FILE 199
//*  OF DD-CARDS IN THE LOGON PROCEDURE IS NOT A VIABLE METHOD OF   *   FILE 199
//*  ALLOCATING USER-SPECIFIC DATASETS AND  IS A DANGEROUS METHOD   *   FILE 199
//*  OF ALLOCATING  SHARED DATASETS.  DYNAMIC ALLOCATION  OF SUCH   *   FILE 199
//*  DATASETS IS PREFERRED                                          *   FILE 199
//*                                                                 *   FILE 199
//*  DYNAMIC  ALLOCATION  BY  THE  USER,  VIA  THE  TSO  ALLOCATE   *   FILE 199
//*  COMMAND, HAS THE ADVANTAGE THAT IF ANY PARTICULAR ALLOCATION   *   FILE 199
//*  FAILS, THE USER  IS INFORMED, AND THE SESSION  IS NOT TERMI-   *   FILE 199
//*  NATED.   HOWEVER,  WHERE  A LARGE  NUMBER  OF  DATASETS  ARE   *   FILE 199
//*  INVOLVED, SUCH ALLOCATIONS MAY TAKE A LONG TIME FOR THE USER   *   FILE 199
//*  TO ENTER.                                                      *   FILE 199
//*                                                                 *   FILE 199
//*  THE CLIST  FACILITY IS A MEANS  BY WHICH THE USER  CAN ENTER   *   FILE 199
//*  THE COMMANDS  TO ALLOCATE THE  REQUIRED DATASETS  ONCE, SAVE   *   FILE 199
//*  THESE COMMANDS  IN A  DATASET, AND  SUBSEQUENTLY INVOKE  THE   *   FILE 199
//*  CLIST INTERPRETER TO READ THAT DATASET AND PERFORM THE ALLO-   *   FILE 199
//*  CATE COMMANDS FOR HIM.  THIS  TECHNIQUE HAS ONLY TWO SIGNIF-   *   FILE 199
//*  ICANT DISADVANTAGES.  THE CLIST INTERPRETER IS A SIGNIFICANT   *   FILE 199
//*  CONSUMER OF CPU  RESOURCES.  SECONDLY, THE USER  IS REQUIRED   *   FILE 199
//*  TO KNOW  AND TO ENTER INTO  HIS CLIST THE NAMES  OF STANDARD   *   FILE 199
//*  SYSTEM DATASETS, WHICH MAY NOT BE UNDER HIS CONTROL.           *   FILE 199
//*                                                                 *   FILE 199
//*  FOR EXAMPLE, LET US ASSUME THAT THE USER DEVELOPS A CLIST TO   *   FILE 199
//*  ALLOCATE THE  DATASETS REQUIRED  BY THE  PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT   *   FILE 199
//*  FACILITY (PDF).  PDF MAY REQUIRE  A LARGE NUMBER OF DATASETS   *   FILE 199
//*  FOR EXECUTION,  SOME OF  WHICH ARE  SYSTEM-MAINTAINED SHARED   *   FILE 199
//*  DATASETS, SUCH AS  THE COMMON PDF PANEL  LIBRARY, FROM WHICH   *   FILE 199
//*  PDF FETCHES THE PANELS TO BE  DISPLAYED AT THE USER'S TERMI-   *   FILE 199
//*  NAL.                                                           *   FILE 199
//*                                                                 *   FILE 199
//*  THE USER  MAY KEEP HIS  OWN COMPLETE  COPY OF THE  PDF PANEL   *   FILE 199
//*  LIBRARY, BUT THIS IS NOT  RECOMMENDED, SINCE THERE MORE THAN   *   FILE 199
//*  A HUNDRES  PANELS IN THIS LIBRARY,  AND THERE IS  SELDOM ANY   *   FILE 199
//*  REASON FOR EACH USER OF PDF TO HAVE AND MAINTAIN A COMPLETE,   *   FILE 199
//*  SEPARATE COPY OF SUCH A LARGE DATASET.  MORE OFTEN, THE USER   *   FILE 199
//*  WILL  SIMPLY USE  WHAT PDF  PROVIDES.  IN  EITHER CASE,  THE   *   FILE 199
//*  DATASET MUST BE  ALLOCATED UNDER THE FILE  NAME ISPPLIB.  AT   *   FILE 199
//*  PRESENT, THE PDF PANEL LIBRARY IS CALLED ISR.V1R1M0.ISRPLIB.   *   FILE 199
//*  THUS, THE USER WOULD HAVE TO CODE THE FOLLOWING COMMAND INTO   *   FILE 199
//*  HIS CLIST:                                                     *   FILE 199
//*                                                                 *   FILE 199
//*    ALLOC  FI(ISPPLIB)  DS('ISR.V1R1M0.ISRPLIB') SHR             *   FILE 199
//*                                                                 *   FILE 199
//*  BUT WHY  SHOULD THE  USER HAVE  TO REMEMBER  THIS CUMBERSOME   *   FILE 199
//*  NAME?  SUPPOSE A NEW RELEASE OF PDF WERE INSTALLED, AND THIS   *   FILE 199
//*  NEW  RELEASE  INCORPORATED  NEW DATASET  NAMES  AND/OR  FILE   *   FILE 199
//*  NAMES.  THE USER WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE HIS OWN CLIST IN ORDER   *   FILE 199
//*  TO KEEP UP  WITH SYSTEM MAINTENANCE.  IF THERE  WERE A LARGE   *   FILE 199
//*  COMMUNITY  OF  PDF USERS,  EACH  WITH  THEIR OWN  CLISTS  TO   *   FILE 199
//*  PRE-ALLOCATE  THE  REQUIRED DATASETS,  HOW  MUCH  CONVERSION   *   FILE 199
//*  WOULD BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO  INSTALL A NEW RELEASE OF PDF,   *   FILE 199
//*  OR SIMPLY TO RENAME ONE OF ITS DATASETS?  THIS IS INCONSIST-   *   FILE 199
//*  ENT WITH  THE PHILOSOPHY OF  ISOLATING THE USER  FROM SYSTEM   *   FILE 199
//*  MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.                                        *   FILE 199

//*  MULTIPLY THIS BY THE MYRIAD NUMBER OF OTHER, SIMILAR COMMAND   *   FILE 199
//*  PROCESSORS WHICH REQUIRE SHARED  DATASETS, AND THE DISADVAN-   *   FILE 199
//*  TAGE  OF HAVING  USERS CODE  CLISTS TO  PERFORM THESE  ALLO-   *   FILE 199

//*                                                                 *   FILE 199
//*  A SINGLE, COMMON  CLIST WHICH ALL USERS COULD USE  IS A MORE   *   FILE 199
//*  ATTRACTIVE  ALTERNATIVE.   INDEED, FOR  SIMPLE  ALLOCATIONS,   *   FILE 199
//*  SUCH A  CLIST WOULD SUFFICE.  BUT  THERE IS OFTEN A  NEED TO   *   FILE 199
//*  INCLUDE    SOME    USER-SPECIFIC   DATASETS    ALONG    WITH   *   FILE 199
//*  SYSTEM-MAINTAINED  DATASETS.  USING  THE  PDF PANEL  LIBRARY   *   FILE 199
//*  EXAMPLE AGAIN,  SUPPOSE A USER  REQUIRES THAT HIS  OWN PANEL   *   FILE 199
//*  LIBRARY, CALLED  U9999XX.PANELLIB, BE ALLOCATED TO  THE ISP-   *   FILE 199
//*  PLIB FILE  NAME, AND  THAT THE  STANDARD PDF  PANEL LIBRARY,   *   FILE 199
//*  ISR.V1R1M0.ISRPLIB, BE CONCATENATED TO IT.  THIS IS A COMMON   *   FILE 199
//*  PRACTICE FOR  PDF, AND EVEN MORE  COMMON IN THE CASE  OF THE   *   FILE 199
//*  DIALOG MANAGER,  WHERE USERS ARE  ALLOWED TO HAVE  THEIR OWN   *   FILE 199

//*                                                                 *   FILE 199
//*  THE REQUIRED TSO ALLOCATE COMMAND WOULD BE:                    *   FILE 199
//*                                                                 *   FILE 199

//*  OR  MORE  CONCATENATIONS,  EITHER AHEAD  OF  OR  BEHIND  THE   *   FILE 199
//*  SYSTEM-MAINTAINED DATASETS, THE CLIST WOULD BECOME EXTREMELY   *   FILE 199

//*           package designed to increase operator productivity    *   FILE 250
//*           by automating tasks which need not be performed       *   FILE 250
//*           manually.  TSSO performs its function through three   *   FILE 250
//*           integrated components.  The Operator Productivity     *   FILE 250
//*           Facility (OPF) extends the power of TSO to the        *   FILE 250
//*           MVS operator's console.  The Automated Operations     *   FILE 250
//*           Facility (AOF) enhances an installation's             *   FILE 250
//*           ability to control system events based on console     *   FILE 250
//*           message traffic.  An interface to the Network         *   FILE 250
//*           Communication Control Facility (NCCF) allows the      *   FILE 250
//*           network operator to use TSSO as a command processor,  *   FILE 250
//*           issuing and receiving operating system commands at    *   FILE 250
//*           the NCCF terminal.  Note that NCCF is now an inte-    *   FILE 250

//*         has been merged into TSSO 4.3 by Guy Albertelli.  So    *   FILE 250
//*         it's probably best to ignore File 402 and install       *   FILE 250
//*         File 250 instead, which is an OS/390 upgrade of the     *   FILE 250

//*          PLEA is a set of programs designed to provide          *   FILE 281
//*     information to a user about a program's performance         *   FILE 281
//*     and, for a  PL/I program, can be used as a debugging        *   FILE 281
//*     tool to show which parts of the program's procedures        *   FILE 281
//*     were executed.  It acts in a manner which is almost         *   FILE 281
//*     totally transparent to the user.                            *   FILE 281
//*                                                                 *   FILE 281
//*          PLEA provides a statistical analysis of where CPU      *   FILE 281
//*     time is being spent during the execution of a PL/I (for     *   FILE 281
//*     Optimizing Compiler) or FORTRAN program.  It operates       *   FILE 281
//*     under OS/VS2 in the 370/168.  It consists of two parts:     *   FILE 281
//*     a monitor and an analyzer.  The monitor samples             *   FILE 281
//*     execution of the program at regular preset intervals        *   FILE 281
//*     until the program terminates.  During the monitoring run    *   FILE 281
//*     (when the program is executing) Monitor Data is spooled     *   FILE 281
//*     off into a dataset which is used by the analyzer to         *   FILE 281
//*     provide an analysis of the program's execution.             *   FILE 281
//*                                                                 *   FILE 281

//*      With 3270 terminals it is possible to format displays      *   FILE 291
//*      so that certain portions of the screen are used for the    *   FILE 291
//*      operator's response and other portions are reserved for    *   FILE 291
//*      use by the program controlling the display.                *   FILE 291
//*                                                                 *   FILE 291
//*      The advantage of using formatted communications over       *   FILE 291
//*      unformatted is that a formatted display may present the    *   FILE 291
//*      operator with more than one request for information at     *   FILE 291
//*      one time.  This lengthens messages between computer and    *   FILE 291
//*      operator; each message contains more information and       *   FILE 291
//*      the rhythm of the communication is more natural.  By       *   FILE 291
//*      grouping related items together in a formatted display     *   FILE 291
//*      each request for information is embedded in a broader      *   FILE 291
//*      context.  From this broader context the operator is able   *   FILE 291
//*      to find a better understanding of the meaning or           *   FILE 291
//*      purpose of information requests and can thus respond       *   FILE 291
//*      with better answers.  The fact that the operator's         *   FILE 291
//*      responses are not transmitted until all requests are       *   FILE 291
//*      satisfied means that the operator has more opportunity     *   FILE 291
//*      to review and revise responses before they are entered.    *   FILE 291
//*      These characteristics of formatted communications mean     *   FILE 291
//*      that the operator has more control over responses and      *   FILE 291
//*      can respond with greater accuracy.                         *   FILE 291

//*                                                                 *   FILE 294
//*           It seems that all of the ad hoc requests that I       *   FILE 294
//*      have written were sufficiently different that I could      *   FILE 294
//*      not simply reuse old ones.  Yet all seemed to have had     *   FILE 294
//*      some things in common.  It became clear that a mechanism   *   FILE 294
//*      was required that could pull bits and pieces from          *   FILE 294
//*      various sources together to satisfy a particular           *   FILE 294
//*      request.  This mechanism had to be very general and        *   FILE 294
//*      flexible in nature since it could potentially accomodate   *   FILE 294
//*      a number of different languages or program products.       *   FILE 294
//*                                                                 *   FILE 294
//*           Basically what was needed was a program that could    *   FILE 294
//*      dynamically include source code or data into a data set    *   FILE 294
//*      or job stream.  Furthermore, it was desirable to change    *   FILE 294
//*      this included code or place some conditions on it.         *   FILE 294
//*                                                                 *   FILE 294
//*           As it turned out, this program immediately showed     *   FILE 294
//*      promise in providing a very general tool with very broad   *   FILE 294
//*      applications.  Many features were suggested by Dick        *   FILE 294
//*      Heddinger, and I would like to express my appreciation.    *   FILE 294

//*     useful for one or the other of the storage admins.  If      *   FILE 300
//*     it's possible you can put it on a new file, because it      *   FILE 300

//*     For the title I've chosen "HSM/SMS front end and            *   FILE 300
